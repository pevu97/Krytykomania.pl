# 📽️ Krytykomania.pl – Movie Rating Sorting Script  

Krytykomania.pl is a Python-based tool that retrieves information about movies from the Polish movie portal **Filmweb** and allows you to create a sorted list of films based on critics' ratings — from best to worst. This solves a key limitation of the original website, which lacks an efficient way to organize movies by rating.
