The program retrieves information about movies from a Polish portal dedicated to cataloging them and allows users to rate them. The script generates a sorted list of movies based on critics' ratings, from best to worst.

--WHAT SHOUD I DO?--

Go to the Filmweb movie database, choose the genre, year, and any other filters you're interested in, then search for movies, save the page as "movies_website.html."
Now, with the help of the script, you can sort the movies from best to worst based on critics' ratings from the Filmweb service, which, in my opinion, is lacking on the original website. 
Remember to use the file for decoding Polish characters and the file that allows you to remove movies without ratings from the list so that they don't affect your ranking.
